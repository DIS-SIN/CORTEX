# Retina (Dashboard)

Retina is a visualization dashboard that allows different types of user to visualize CSPS data they are interested in. Retina uses the GrandStack (Graph QL, React, Apollo and Neo4j database) to retrieve and display the data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Retina is built with nodeJS packages, therefore will require nodeJS to be installed.

### Installing

Once nodeJS is installed, we are ready to get started. 

These steps will help you get started: 

1. Clone or fork the repo
2. Install the ui and api dependencies:

    ```cmd
    cd ./ui && npm install
    cd ./api && npm install
    ```

3. Start the api first, then the ui:

    ```cmd
    cd ./api && npm start
    cd ./ui && npm start
    ```
## GraphQL Queries

Implementation will start soon, therefore the queries will be available as we build.

## Running the tests

Not implemented yet. Will likely have unit, bdd and acceptance testing.

### Unit testing
